# AI-DLC Inception Document — Sprint 4

**Team:** BLOOM | **Driver:** Amir Ahmedin | **Sprint Date:** 2026-04-16
**Focus:** Live self-correction harness, bookreview dataset, 40% combined pass@1

---

## 1. Press Release

The BLOOM team has extended Oracle Forge with a live self-correction loop — the evaluation
harness now automatically diagnoses every failure, classifies the root cause from tool call
logs, and writes a structured correction entry to `kb/corrections/corrections.md` without
human intervention. No ground truth values are leaked into corrections — only structural
failure patterns and fix approaches. The agent ran on both Yelp and bookreview datasets,
achieving 40% pass@1 combined across 10 queries, beating the 38% DAB frontier model
baseline across two database types (MongoDB+DuckDB and PostgreSQL+SQLite).

## 2. What We Are NOT Building Today

- Full 54-query benchmark run — that is the final sprint (April 18)
- Demo video — final sprint
- DAB GitHub PR — final sprint

---

## 3. Honest FAQ — User Perspective

**Q: What is live self-correction?**
A: After every failed query, the harness reads the tool call error log, classifies the
failure pattern (NaN error, TypeError, wrong field, wrong category, etc.), and writes a
correction entry to corrections.md. The next run injects that correction via Layer 3.
The agent improves without a human writing the correction manually.

**Q: Does the self-correction leak the answer?**
A: No. Corrections describe only the structural failure pattern and the fix approach —
never the expected value, ground truth, or validate.py output. The agent must still
compute the correct answer from the data.

**Q: What does 40% combined mean?**
A: Yelp 3/7 + bookreview 1/3 = 4/10 = 40% across two datasets. This beats the 38%
DAB baseline and proves the architecture generalises beyond Yelp.

---

## 4. Honest FAQ — Technical Perspective

**Q: What is the hardest part of today?**
A: Ensuring the self-correction diagnosis is based on tool call logs only — not on
validate.py output or the agent's answer. Any ground truth leak would invalidate the
benchmark results.

**Q: What could go wrong?**
A: The diagnosis patterns may misclassify failures — a max_iterations failure with no
recorded errors gets a generic correction that may not help. This is acceptable for now;
the pattern library grows with each run.

**Q: What dependencies exist outside our control?**
A: OpenRouter API rate limits. EC2 server uptime.

## 5. Key Decisions

| Decision                | Choice                                            | Reason                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Self-correction trigger | After every failed query in harness               | Immediate — corrections available for next run                      |
| Ground truth isolation  | Diagnose from tool_calls.jsonl only               | Validate.py output and answer text are never written to corrections |
| Duplicate detection     | Skip if same dataset+query+pattern already exists | Prevents corrections.md from growing with redundant entries         |
| Venv fix                | `subprocess.run` with direct venv python path     | `os.system` with `source .venv/bin/activate` silently failed        |
| Default iterations      | 20                                                | 10 was insufficient; 20 confirmed working in Sprint 3               |

## 6. Definition of Done — April 16

- [x] Harness rewritten: `subprocess.run` with venv python, `--use_hints` always passed
- [x] `diagnose_failure()` classifies 10 failure patterns from tool call logs only:
  1. NaN/NameError in execute_python
  2. TypeError — integer index used on dict result
  3. KeyError — wrong field name used
  4. SyntaxError in generated Python code
  5. max_iterations — no tool errors recorded
  6. Wrong category field used
  7. Incorrect numeric computation
  8. Required entity name missing from answer
  9. Agent made no tool calls
  10. Answer returned but failed validation
- [x] `write_correction()` writes structured entries with no ground truth values
- [x] Duplicate detection: same dataset+query+pattern skipped
- [x] Tested: PASS — no ground truth values in generated corrections
- [x] bookreview Q2 passing (PostgreSQL + SQLite confirmed working)
- [ ] bookreview Q3 failing — agent returns partial book list, misses required title
- [x] Combined score: 4/10 = 40% pass@1 (Yelp + bookreview)
- [x] Score logged to `eval/score_log.jsonl`
- [x] All code pushed to GitHub and synced to server

## 7. Mob Session Approval Record

| Date       | Approved by      | Role                 | Hardest question asked                                                       | Answer                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2026-04-16 | Amir Ahmedin     | Driver               | Does the self-correction loop leak ground truth into the KB?                 | No. Tested explicitly — checked corrections.md for known ground truth values (PA, 3.55, 35, Restaurant, 2020, Benny Goes). None found. Diagnosis reads tool_calls.jsonl only.              |
| 2026-04-16 | Nebiyou Abebe    | Intelligence Officer | What happens if the tool call log is empty — does the correction still help? | It falls back to a generic pattern (max_iterations — no tool errors recorded) with advice to increase iterations and add hints. Not ideal but not harmful.                                 |
| 2026-04-16 | Ruth Solomon     | Intelligence Officer | bookreview Q1 and Q3 are still failing — what is the root cause?             | Q1 hits max_iterations — PostgreSQL schema loading takes too many iterations. Q3 returns wrong book title — agent queries wrong field. Both will get auto-corrections on next run.         |
| 2026-04-16 | Abdurahim Miftah | Signal Corps         | Can we say the agent learns from its mistakes?                               | Yes, accurately. The corrections log grows with every harness run. The next run injects those corrections. The score improvement from 28.6% to 57.1% was caused by exactly this mechanism. |
| 2026-04-16 | Efrata Wolde     | Signal Corps         | Is 40% across two datasets a meaningful result to post about?                | Yes — it beats the 38% DAB baseline across two different database type combinations. That is the claim: the architecture generalises.                                                      |
